# GraphAlg

Displays graphs and result of simple graph algorithms

Program works on Windows eighter on Linux.

You will need to have Qt 4 and OGDF (ogdf.v2007.11). 

To compile OGDF for Windows on MinGW look at my oter projects on Github.

For Visuals Studio use dedicated "Command Prompt".

For MinGW try QT command prompt.

Clone repository, then type:

make debug

After buit change directory to Debug and run program "GraphAlg" from QT Command Prompt.

More info soon :)
