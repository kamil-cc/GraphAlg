# GraphAlg

Application for displaying graphs and results of simple graph algorithms. It runs on Linux either on Windows.  
To compile GraphAlg You will need to have Qt 4 and OGDF (ogdf.v2007.11). 
To compile OGDF library for Windows on MinGW please have a look at my other project: https://github.com/kamil-cc/OGDF4MinGW


For MinGW try QT command prompt.

Clone repository, then type:

qmake

make debug

After buit change directory to Debug and run program "GraphAlg" from QT Command Prompt.

The "Tree layout" won't work on Windows.

More info soon :)


It is also possible  Visuals Studio use dedicated "Command Prompt".
