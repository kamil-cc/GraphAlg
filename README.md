# GraphAlg
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamil-cc/GraphAlg/master/screen.png)  
Application for displaying graphs and results of simple graph algorithms. It runs on Linux either on Windows.  
To compile GraphAlg You will need to have Qt 4 and OGDF (ogdf.v2007.11).  
To find out how to compile OGDF library on MinGW please have a look at my other project: https://github.com/kamil-cc/OGDF4MinGW  
Clone repository, then run QT Command Prompt. Type:  

qmake

make debug

After build, change directory to Debug and run program "GraphAlg" from QT Command Prompt.  
Info: "Tree layout" won't work on Windows.  
Example input files can be found at: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/67722658/Github/GraphAlg/GraphAlgInput.zip  
  
It is also possible to use Visuals Studio for building OGDF and GraphAlg.
